## Overview <!-- Must include -->
While autonomous robots have seen significant research advancements in recent years, due to the harsh nature of underwater environment, there is limited availability in finding off-the-shelf underwater robots for various applications. Custom-built underwater robots may be necessary for specialized applications or missions, but the process can be more costly, time-consuming, and requiring expert knowledge. This challenge makes validation and verification process difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a modular underwater robot that can serve as an open-source testbed system that is customizable and subject to environmental variability.

## Research Goals <!-- Remove if not applicable -->
* Mechanical team aims to design based on BlueROV2's design (from BlueRobotics).  
* Electrical team aims to design PCBs that can manage different sensor and actuator configurations.
* Software team aims to design a software system that can operate easily with ROS system.
