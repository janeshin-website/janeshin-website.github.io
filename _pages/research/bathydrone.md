description: We aim to create and test a system capable of measuring underwater areas and features in areas highly prone to change, including but not limited to coastal areas, tidal zones, ports, canals or water bodies that have an immediate impact on the hydrologic health of an ecosystem. The “bathydrone” is an unpowered boat equipped with a down-scan and side-scan sonar transducer mounted on the hull, towed by a medium-sized UAV.

## Overview <!-- Must include -->
We aim to create and test a system capable of measuring underwater areas and features in areas highly prone to change, including but not limited to coastal areas, tidal zones, ports, canals or water bodies that have an immediate impact on the hydrologic health of an ecosystem. The “bathydrone” is an unpowered boat equipped with a down-scan and side-scan sonar transducer mounted on the hull, towed by a medium-sized UAV.

## Research Goals <!-- Remove if not applicable -->
* Efficient Underwater 3D Point Cloud Mapping using Sonar
* "Dual-control": developing a path planning and control algorithm for the drone such that the sonar unit can scan the targeted area. Considering bridge inspection applications, collision avoidance will also be considered in this algorithm.
* Underwater camera and sonar fusion: bathydrone system can equip underwater camera inside. By utilizing underwater camera and sonar data obtained from the same pose, sensor fusion algorithm will be developed to improve accuracy in underwater environment monitoring.
