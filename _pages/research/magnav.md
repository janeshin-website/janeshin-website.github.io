## Overview <!-- Must include -->
Put a paragraph here to describe the project. Also, you can include research questions. Try to be concise and informative and limit the length to 3-5 sentences.

## Research Goals <!-- Remove if not applicable -->
* Use these bullet points to clearly show the research goals and objectives under this research project.
  * You can also use indent if needed. But it can make the list look text-heavy and dense.
* So, it's preferred to use short phrases when you use the indent.
* For example, you can use it to list some nouns or items.

1. Cite publication with IEEE reference style. Then list the links to paper, slides, videos, codes per each item
