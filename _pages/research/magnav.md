## Overview <!-- Must include -->
Although many outdoor autonomous robotics systems rely on GPS, there are some situations or applications where GPS signal is unavailable, e.g., navigation in an underwater environment, receiving a degraded or jammed GPS signal. One solution to this GPS-denied navigation is magnetic anomaly-based navigation, which allows robots to localize based on a series of magnetometer readings and a pre-known magnetic field map. In this project, we focus on developing information-driven active localization methods that plan a path for reducing localization uncertainty.

## Research Goals
* Use these bullet points to clearly show the research goals and objectives under this research project.
  * You can also use indent if needed. But it can make the list look text-heavy and dense.
* So, it's preferred to use short phrases when you use the indent.
* For example, you can use it to list some nouns or items.
