## Overview <!-- Must include -->

Although many outdoor autonomous robotics systems rely on GPS, there are some situations or applications where GPS signal is unavailable, e.g., navigation in an underwater environment, receiving a degraded or jammed GPS signal. One solution to this GPS-denied navigation is magnetic anomaly-based navigation, which allows robots to localize based on a series of magnetometer readings and a pre-known magnetic field map. In this project, we focus on developing information-driven active localization methods that plan a path for reducing localization uncertainty.

## Research Goals

* Passively sensed navigation on ground robots that leverage maximum information available in *a priori* maps
* Wholistic approach for mapping and localization in magnetic scalar field maps
* Object and agent detection for passive sensing
