                <title>In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: It goes on</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-learning&quot;&gt;Formal learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play. Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture. This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Nonformal learning&lt;/a&gt; and combined approaches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Reading directions&lt;/a&gt; helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik’s Cube&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Practicing the moves repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; helps build “muscle memory” and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Thinking critically about moves&lt;/a&gt; helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Observing the Rubik’s Cube’s six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as cellular phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it’s called augmented learning. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner’s natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition, based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is less structured than “nonformal” one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, play, exploring, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-factors&quot;&gt;Internal factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child’s learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when “… cued, primed, and guided…” and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor’s plans and the student’s expectations. An example of incidental teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Love the life you live. Live the life you love</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-learning&quot;&gt;Formal learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play. Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture. This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Practicing the moves repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; helps build “muscle memory” and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Thinking critically about moves&lt;/a&gt; helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Observing the Rubik’s Cube’s six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as cellular phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it’s called augmented learning. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner’s natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition, based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is less structured than “nonformal” one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, play, exploring, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-factors&quot;&gt;Internal factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child’s learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when “… cued, primed, and guided…” and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor’s plans and the student’s expectations. An example of incidental teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formal-learning&quot;&gt;Formal learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play. Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture. This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as cellular phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it’s called augmented learning. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner’s natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition, based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is less structured than “nonformal” one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, play, exploring, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-factors&quot;&gt;Internal factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child’s learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when “… cued, primed, and guided…” and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor’s plans and the student’s expectations. An example of incidental teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture. This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Reading directions&lt;/a&gt; helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik’s Cube&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Practicing the moves repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; helps build “muscle memory” and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Thinking critically about moves&lt;/a&gt; helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Observing the Rubik’s Cube’s six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as cellular phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it’s called augmented learning. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner’s natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition, based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is less structured than “nonformal” one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, play, exploring, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child’s learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when “… cued, primed, and guided…” and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In incidental teaching learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor’s plans and the student’s expectations. An example of incidental teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
